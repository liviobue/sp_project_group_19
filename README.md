The application is a stock market analysis tool that provides users with various functions for exploring and analyzing stock data. It allows users to retrieve stock information, visualize historical stock prices, calculate correlations with the S&P 500 index, perform statistical tests and generate reports.

Please note:
Due to occasional issues with the external API used to retrieve stock data, users may experience intermittent bugs or errors when retrieving data. These issues are beyond the control of the application and may occur when the API experiences downtime or rate limitations. The application is designed to handle such situations appropriately and display appropriate error messages as needed. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by these temporary limitations.
